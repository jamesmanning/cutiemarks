Like real ponies, though, the ponies in the show maintain [bilateral symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology#Bilateral_symmetry), so the cutie mark viewed from one side of the pony will be the same as the one on the other side **except** that it will be _flipped horizontally_.\r\n\r\nIn terms of css, it means applying a [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform): scaleX(-1) to the image.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of this is Rainbow Dash.  Her cutie mark:\r\n\r\n![Rainbow Dash left-side cutie mark](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/a/a9/AiP_CM_Rainbow_Dash.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/246?cb=20160715140422)\r\n\r\nOn her left side, her cutie mark has the 'jagged part' moving toward the right as you follow the bolt from top to bottom (toward her tail).\r\n\r\n![Rainbow Dash left-side cutie mark example 1](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/9/94/Rainbow_Dash_successfully_scares_her_friends_S1E02.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20121127062432)\r\n\r\n![Rainbow Dash left-side cutie mark example 2](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/d/d0/Rainbow_Dash_talks_to_Twilight_S1E01.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20121105032516)\r\n\r\nOn her right side, her cutie mark has the 'jagged part' moving toward the left instead (but still toward her tail!)\r\n\r\n![Rainbow Dash right-side cutie mark example 1](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/b/b6/Twilight_get_cornered_S1E2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20130118031257)\r\n\r\n![Rainbow Dash right-side cutie mark example 2](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/6/6c/Fluttershy_and_Rainbow_Dash_catch_Twilight_S01E02.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20111205163155)\r\n\r\nThis is something that's easy to overlook about the ponies, and many people will make fan art or drawings of the ponies without really noticing which version of the cutie mark should be used on which side.\r\n\r\nIf using the MLP wikia of a character as a reference, [the image they show for a character's cutie mark](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Cutie_marks/Gallery) is the one from the left side of the character.\r\n\r\nJust knowing that the cutie mark is flipped from one side to the other is the key point.  While the show itself sometimes gets them wrong, you can generally refer to the show to see which version is on which side.  Here are the cutie marks of some of the main characters to help\r\n\r\n|Character         |Left-side cutie mark|\r\n|------------------|:------------------:|\r\n| Rainbow Dash     |  ![Rainbow Dash](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/a/a9/AiP_CM_Rainbow_Dash.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20160715140422) |\r\n| Twilight Sparkle |    ![Twilight Sparkle](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/1/1f/AiP_CM_Twilight_Sparkle.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20110805232146)   |\r\n| Applejack | ![Applejack](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/e/ee/AiP_CM_Applejack.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20110805224608) |\r\n| Fluttershy | ![](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/5/5a/AiP_CM_Fluttershy.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20110805224715) |\r\n| Rarity | ![](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/2/29/AiP_CM_Rarity.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20110805225051) |\r\n| Pinkie Pie | ![](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/3/34/AiP_CM_Pinkie_Pie.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20110805224817) |",
